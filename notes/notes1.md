# Quantitative trading/finance learning notes

## Wiener process
Random walk with indpendent incremenets and normally distributed with mean 0.
* Paths are *almost surely* continuous functions of time
* Independent
* Normal distribution centered on 0
* Martingale property: the expected value of the process at any *future* time, given all the past information, is the current value 

Increment $W(t) - W(s)$ follows a zero-mean normal distribution and variance t - s

Variance at time t = t - i.e. variance inevitably increases as time increases

## Some models
* Black Scholes Merton model
* Fama French factor model
* GARCH models
* Monte carlo simulatiosn
* ARIMA (time series)

## Some fields
* Financial maths/statistical analysis
* Stochastic processes
* Time series analysis
* ML :)
* Behavioral finance

* History
* Parsing signals
* Data preprocessing/feature engineering
* Use OSS repos

## In firms

New hires are given a training period
1. Research
2. Backtest 
3. Run simulations

zero sum game

> Quants in general are not hired right out of school to be quants. This is because you do not want a quant running with an idea that does not make business sense. The first thing you want a quant to realize is whether the project makes business sense.

> The best experience for a quant is to be a regular trader first, get a sense of the business then break off into the specialty. Much like how a doctor is educated- generalist first, specialist second. I started as a regular equity trader. This helps when making hte most important decision of deciding whether a certain line of investigation will be worth doing. Many ideas are scrapped because while the idea may be interesting, it does not make business sense when it boils down to dollars and real world restrictions.

> If I were forced to define it, I'd say that a large part of it is the ability to seamlessly 'zoom in' and 'zoom out' in terms of one's manner of thinking. . you need to be able to fully entertain and flesh out the broader perspective findings, as well as the narrower perspective findings, and then mesh these together. . . which brings me to the second innate trait, which is the ability to look at data in a 'just' and objective way, intuitively knowing what is valuable and important, and what isn't. . knowing what to be excited about and intrigued by, and what to ignore or treat as a non-issue.
